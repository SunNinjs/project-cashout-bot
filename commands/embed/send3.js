**__PACKAGING:__** 

> Please make sure your products are properly packaged and taped to prevent any damage. 
> 
> Any box that you use to ship is acceptable, we recommend to ship 2 consoles per box.

If you donâ€™t have any boxes that fit, [here are some recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2NWHaN6usiIax5jAyARRUTbgUNfRWnWlpALQkFJxj4/edit?usp=sharing)

**__SHIPPING:__**

**Labels will be provided for you after you open a ticket to ship.**

**Factors to keep in mind,**
> 1. The weight on the label will not have to match the actual weight. UPS will charge our account the right amount for each package after.
> 2. The return address on the label will be our address instead of your home address. This helps to quicken the process of label generating.
> **3. Please use the smallest box you have that can fit the consoles, to prevent any damages.**
